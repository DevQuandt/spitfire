            <h1>About {{appTitle}}</h1>
        </div>
        <p>{{appTitle}} is a virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple persons at the same time. Users will be
            anonymous - so no one needs to sign in.</p>

        {{#if hasSessionName}}
            <p><a href="/{{home}}">Just go back to <b>{{sessionName}}</b></a> and share the URL with the
                people you want to work with. Anyone who has access to that URL can participate in your work.
            </p>
        {{else}}
            <p><a href="/">Just start a new session</a> and share the URL with the
                people you want to work with. Anyone who has access to that URL can participate in your work.
            </p>

        <p><b>Writing and editing:</b> After creating or opening a session, you can write text by double clicking
            anywhere in the browser window. Already existing text can be edited by double clicking on it. And hey,
            writing markdown is supported.</p>

        <p><b>Drag and resize:</b> Drag the text around and resize text boxes as you like.</p>

        <p><b>Voting: </b>Dot voting is possible by clicking on the ▲ symbol that appears top left when hovering
            over a
            text, down voting by clicking on the ▼ symbol.</p>

        <p><b>Filtering:</b> You can filter out the contents you are interested in, simply by typing a text
            pattern that has to be part of the contents you want to have on the screen (use the input area in the top
            left corner of the window). E.g. a filter of
            <mark>Spitfire</mark>
            will show you everything that does contain the
            pattern
            <mark>Spitfire</mark>
            . You can do negative filtering by putting the -- prefix in front of your
            filter. E.g.
            <mark>--Spitfire</mark>
            will show you everything that does not contain the pattern <i>Spitfire</i>.
            Filtering won´t affect the other participants of a shared whiteboard session and it will ignore case.
        </p>

        <p><b>Grid:</b> In the top left corner you can define a grid in pixels. If you do so, elements will be snapped
            to that grid when they are dragged around or created. You can even define your grid in the URL of your
            whiteboard session, just by adding somethig like
            <mark>,grid:200x25</mark>
            to your URL. In this example 200 is the grid column width in pixels and 25 is the grid row height in pixels.
            Set a grid for columns only by adding
            <mark>,grid:200</mark>
            and for rows only by adding
            <mark>,grid:x25</mark>
            . The grid will be indicated on the canvas if the value for either columns or rows is at least {{minGrid}}
            or above. If you change your grid settings, the other participants of the whiteboard session will not be
            affected.
        </p>

        <p><b>Multi select:</b> Select multiple items by <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>CLICK</kbd> (Mac) or
            <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>CLICK</kbd> (Win) on the items. Alternatively you can <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>DRAG</kbd> /
            <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>DRAG</kbd> to draw a rectangle on the screen. Any item that is touched by the rectangle
            will be selected.</p>

        <p><b>Align:</b> When you have selected multiple items, you can align the items left with
            <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>←</kbd>. Align top, right or bottom by using the other
            arrow keys. Please be careful with these operations, as currently there is no undo function available.</p>

        <p>{{appTitle}} is free to use for everyone. It is built and shared by <a href="http://ulf.codes"
                                                                                  target="_blank">Ulf&nbsp;Schneider</a>
            and it is developed while obeying the agile mantra: Make the simplest thing that
            will possibly work now. Validate. Repeat. Yay.
