            <h1>About {{appTitle}}</h1>
        </div>


        <p>{{appTitle}} is a virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple persons at the same time. Users will be
            anonymous - so no one needs to sign in.</p>

        {{#if hasSessionName}}
            <p><a href="{{home}}">Just go back to <b>{{sessionName}}</b></a> and share the URL with the
                people you want to work with. Anyone who has access to that URL can participate in your work.
            </p>
        {{else}}
            <p><a href="/">Just start a new session</a> and share the URL with the
                people you want to work with. Anyone who has access to that URL can participate in your work.
            </p>
        {{/if}}

        <p>{{appTitle}} is free to use. It is built and shared by <a href="http://ulf.codes"
                                                                     target="_blank">Ulf&nbsp;Schneider</a>
            and it is developed while obeying the agile mantra: Make the simplest thing that
            will possibly work now. Validate. Repeat. Yay.
        </p>


        <h3>Writing and editing</h3>

        <p>After creating or opening a session, you can write text by clicking
            anywhere in the browser window. Already existing text can also be edited by clicking on it. And hey,
            writing markdown is supported.</p>

        <h3>Undo and redo</h3>

        <p>Use <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> (on a Mac) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> (on Windows) to undo your actions
            and
            <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> / <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> to redo.
            You can only undo/redo what you have done during a session and not what other participants have done.</p>

        <h3>Drag and resize</h3>

        <p>Drag the text around and resize text boxes as you like.</p>

        <h3>Multi select</h3>

        <p>Select multiple items by <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>CLICK</kbd> /
            <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>CLICK</kbd> on the items. Alternatively you can <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>DRAG</kbd> /
            <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>DRAG</kbd> to draw a rectangle on the screen. Any item that is touched by the rectangle
            will be selected.</p>

        <h3>Align</h3>

        <p>When you have selected multiple items, you can align the items left with
            <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>←</kbd>. Align top, right or bottom by using the other
            arrow keys.</p>

        <h3>Connect</h3>

        <p>Draw a connection from one item to the other by holding down <kbd>Alt</kbd> (and keep down), click on the
            father item and then click on the son item. Finally release the <kbd>Alt</kbd>-key.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to create a new item which should be connected to a father, again, hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> (and
            keep down), click on the father and then click at the position inside of the browser window where the new
            item should be created. As the last step release the <kbd>Alt</kbd>-key.</p>

        <p>You get rid of a connection by double clicking on the son item (the one the connction arrow is pointing
            to).</p>

        <h3>Voting</h3>

        <p>Dot voting is possible by clicking on the ▲ symbol that appears top left when hovering
            over a
            text, down voting by clicking on the ▼ symbol.</p>

        <h3>Filtering</h3>

        <p>You can filter out those contents you are interested in, simply by typing a text
            pattern that has to be part of the contents you want to have on the screen (use the input area in the top
            left corner of the window). E.g. a filter of
            <mark>{{appTitle}}</mark>
            will show you everything that does contain the
            pattern
            <mark>{{appTitle}}</mark>
            . You can do negative filtering by putting the -- prefix in front of your
            filter. E.g.
            <mark>--{{appTitle}}</mark>
            will show you everything that does not contain the pattern <i>{{appTitle}}</i>.
            Filtering won´t affect the other participants of a shared whiteboard session and it will ignore case.
        </p>

        <h3>Grid</h3>

        <p>In the top left corner you can define a grid in pixels. If you do so, elements will be snapped
            to that grid when they are dragged around or created. You can even define your grid in the URL of your
            whiteboard session, just by adding somethig like
            <mark>,grid:200x25</mark>
            to your URL. In this example 200 is the grid column width in pixels and 25 is the grid row height in pixels.
            Set a grid for columns only by adding
            <mark>,grid:200</mark>
            and for rows only by adding
            <mark>,grid:x25</mark>
            . The grid will be indicated on the canvas if the value for either columns or rows is at least {{minGrid}}
            or above. If you change your grid settings, the other participants of the whiteboard session will not be
            affected.
        </p>

        <h3>Import</h3>

        <p>You can import any text file into {{appTitle}} by dragging and dropping the file on top of the {{appTitle}}
            editor window. Each line of the text file will become a seperate text object that will appear in your editor
            window.
        </p>
